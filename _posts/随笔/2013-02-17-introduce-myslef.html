    <p>My name is Tiejinlong, and English name is Terro. I am 23 years old and I come from Tengchong, the beautiful tourist city of Yunnan Province. I am seeking an opportunity to work with computer as an engineer. I have a bachelor degree with a major in surveying and mapping engineering. In July 2011, I graduated from Tongji University, which is widely considered one of the most famous universities in China. During the 4 years undergraduate study, my academic records kept distinguished. I learned some of programming languages , like VB, C++,Lisp and Matlab and I did complete a lot of programming homework, for example, in 2009-summer-practice, I wrote a small program which can make CAD read the coordinates data then draw the aerial map automatically. Besides, I like reading and running , I have read a lot of famous works like Gone with the wind, Pride and Prejudice, Jane Eyre. I took part in Shanghai international marathon and got a medal in 2009.</p>
