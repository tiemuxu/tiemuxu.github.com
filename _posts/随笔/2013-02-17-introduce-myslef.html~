	<p>My name is Tiejinlong, and English name is Terro. I am 23 years old and I come from Tengchong, the beautiful tourist city of Yunnan Province. I am seeking an opportunity to work with computer as an engineer. I have a bachelor degree with a major in surveying and mapping engineering. In July 2011, I graduated from Tongji University, which is widely considered one of the most famous universities in China. During the 4 years undergraduate study, my academic records kept distinguished. I learned some of programming languages , like VB, C++,Lisp and Matlab and I did complete a lot of programming homework, for example, in 2009-summer-practice, I wrote a small program which can make CAD read the coordinates data then draw the aerial map automatically. Besides, I like reading and running , I have read a lot of famous works like Gone with the wind, Pride and Prejudice, Jane Eyre. I took part in Shanghai international marathon and got a medal in 2009.  </p>

    <!--<p>果然，富坚义博的《猎人》才是我心中的神作。有人说它达到了哲学的高度，某些篇章甚至能够超越托尔斯泰。我不了解托尔斯泰，只是觉得《猎人》世界观上的设定实在让人惊叹。</p>
	<br />
	<p>在各种热血漫画里，神奇的能力层出不穷，却大都与现实世界完全脱离，不着边际。唯有这部漫画，它的世界观在其内在逻辑上竟跟我们所处的现实世界深度吻合。比如念能力的誓约与制约，发动条件与解除条件，无一不体现出它逻辑严密的规则性，想想现实世界，小到游戏与竞技比赛，大到机构甚至国家体制，唯有在规则的制约下才能良好运转。猎人世界不仅仅拥有天马行空的神奇能力，更有其背后严密的逻辑与规则来做支撑，跟现实世界简直如出一辙。</p>
	<br />
	<p>再比如，冲突的双方在事件中都看不到事实的全部真相，只能根据有限的信息来指导行动，不断判断，不断计划，却又不断遭遇意外（各自的意外对于对方来说却是逻辑的必然），最终将事件引入更复杂的境地，不正是像极了现实世界的人为与天意吗？我们要做成某件事，固然需要自身对事情的把握与判断并付出必要的努力，把我们能够控制的部分做到最好，剩下的不可控因素就只能听天由命，成败只看天意了。</p>
	<br />
	<p>光就故事本身而言也已足够精彩，只不过看的过程需要开动大脑，再不能像《海贼》《火影》那样傻呵呵地看了，《猎人》里到处是推理与分析，连念能力的发动与运用规则，也需要读者跟着思考才能看得明白。漫画也有不少政治的成分，在【蚂蚁篇】中提到的封闭小国，常常用手中的核武器要挟世界，勒索经济援助，然后利益集团再把援助金瓜分殆尽，底层民众分文不得，这不是在赤裸裸的讽刺NK吗？总之，漫画涉及到很多东西，文学，心理学，政治常识，某些行为的概率统计等等，你只能感叹，“富坚老贼”实在是博学多识！</p>-->
